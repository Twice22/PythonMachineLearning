Sequential feature selection algorithms are a family of greedy
search algorithms that are used to reduce an initial d-dimensional
feature space to a k-dimensional feature subspace where k < d.

A classic sequential feature selection algorithm is Sequential
Backward Selection (SBS). SBS is quite simple. We just remove a
feature from the full feature subset and we check the difference
in performance and we keep going on like that. Here are the steps :

	- Initialize the algorithm with k = d, d being the dimensionality of the full feature space Xd

	- Determine the feature x- that maximizes x- = argmaxJ(Xk -x)
	where x â‚¬ Xk

	- Remove the feature x- from the feature set

	- Terminate if k equals the number of desired features, if not
	go to stop 2.
