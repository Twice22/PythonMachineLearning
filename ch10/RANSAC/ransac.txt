Linear regression models can be heavily impacted by the presence of
outliers. In certain situations, a very small subset of our data can
have a big effect on the estimated model coeff. There are methods to
put ouliers away but it required our analysis as a data scientist.

We can also make use of the RANSAC (RANdil SAloke Consensus)
algorithm which fits a reg model to a subset of the data :
The steps are :
	
	1 - Select a random number of samples to be inliers and fit the
		model

	2 - Test  all other data points against the fitted model and add
		those pts that fall within a user-given tolerance to the
		inliers

	3 - Refit the model using all inliers

	4 - Estimate the error of the fitted model versus the inliers

	5 - Terminate the algorithm if the performance meets a certain
		user-defined threshold or if a fixed number of iterations
		has been reached; go back to step 1 otherwise.


Note : using RANSAC, we reduced the potential effect of the outliers
in the dataset but we don't know if this approach has a positive
effect on the predictive performance for unseen data. we need to
further discuss how to evaluate a regresion model for different
approaches.
