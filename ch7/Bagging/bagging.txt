Bagging works a bit like MajorityVoting besides that fact that in
bagging instead of using the same training set to fit the individual
clasifiers in the ensemble, we draw bootstrap samples (random
samples with replacement) from the initial training set. see p220

Bagging algorithm can be an effective approach to reduce the
variance of a model. However bagging is ineffective in reducing
model bias.
