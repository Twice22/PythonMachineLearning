to create a forest here are the steps :
- randomly choose n samples from the training set with replacement
- Grow a decision tree from that sample. At each node :
	- Randomly select d features without replacement
	- Split the node using the feature that provides the best
	  split according to the objective fct, for instance, by
	  maximazing the information gain.
- Repeat the steps 1 to 2 k times.
- Aggregate the prediction by each tree to assign the class label
  by majority vote (see Ch5 for majority vote).
