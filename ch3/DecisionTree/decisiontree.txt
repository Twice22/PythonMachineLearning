you can export the decision tree with export_graphviz module
from sklearn.tree. Just take a look at the code sample. To
visualize the newly generated .dot document we can use :

graphviz from http://www.graphviz.org

After having installed graphviz we can generate a png from
the .doc file using this command line in the location where
the .doc file is settled :

> dot -Tpng tree.dot -o tree.png
