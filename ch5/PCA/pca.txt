pca stands for Principal component analysis and is an unsupervised
learning transformation technique that allows to transfrome a d
dimensional space into a k dimensional subspace (k < d). Here is how
it works :

	1 - Standardize the d-dimensional dataset (feature having same scale)

	2 - Construct the covariance matrix

	3 - Decompose the covariance matrix into its eigenvectors and
	eigenvalues.

	4 - Select k eigenvectors that correspond to the k largest
	eigenvalues, where k is the dimensionality of the new feature
	subspace (k <= d)

	5 - Construct a projection matrix W from the "top" k eigenvectors.

	6 - Transform the d-dimensional input dataset X using the projection matrix W to obtain the new k-dim feature subspace :
	z = xW.
