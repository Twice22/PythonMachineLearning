roc stands for Receiver Operator Characteristic. It's a useful tool
for selecting models for classification based on their performance
with respect to the false positive and true positive rates.

The diagonal of a ROC graph can be interpreted as random guessing,
and classification models that fall below the diagonal are
considered as worse than random guessing.

A perfect classifier would fall into the top-left corner of the
graph with a true positive rate of 1 and a false positive rate of 0.

Based on the ROC curve we can then compute the AUC (area under 
curve) to KR the performance of a classification model.

similarly we can use precision-recall curves which are implemented
in scikit-learn
