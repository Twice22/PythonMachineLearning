hard clustering :
	- similar to k-means : each sample is assigned to ONE cluster

soft clustering :
	- example : fuzzy C-means (FCM)
	- assign a sample to one or more clusters (with its probability)

example, a membership vector in FCM could be represented as follows :

			| μ(1) -> 0.1 |
			| μ(2) -> 0.85|
			| μ(3) -> 0.05|

the sum of the memberships for a given sample is equal to 1.


Here is the FCM algorithm :

	1. Specify the number of k centroids and randomly assign the cluster

	2. Compute the cluster centroids μ(j), j € {1,...,k}

	3. Update the cluster memberships for each point.

	4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the membership coefficients do not
	   change or a user-defined tolerance or a max nb of iterations is
	   reached.


The objective function of FCM we minimize is :

	Jm = Σ(i=1..n)Σ(j=1..k) w^(m(i,j))||x(i) - μ(j)||², m € [1, +inf[

	where m is the fuzziness coefficient that controls the degree of
	fuzziness.

	the cluster membership proability itself is calculated with 
	formula p319
