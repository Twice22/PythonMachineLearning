hierarchical clustering algorihm allows us to plot dendrograms
(visualizations of a binary hierarchical clustering) which can help
with the interpretation of the results by creating meaningful
taxonomies.

Another advantage is that we do not need to provide the nb of cluster
a priori.

2 approaches :
	- divisive : start with one cluster and iteratively split the cluster
	  into smaller clusters until each cluster only contains one sample

	- agglomerative : start with each sample as an individual cluster
	  and merge the closest pairs of clusters until only one cluster
	  remains

2 ways of linkage (see p326):
	- single linkage
	- complete linkage
	- ...also average linkage and ward's linkage


steps for agglomerative clustering using complete linkage approach :

	1 - Compute the distance matrix of all samples.
	2 - Represent each data point as a singleton cluster.
	3 - Merge the two closest clusters based on the distance of
		the most dissimilar (distant) members.
	4 - Update the similarity matrix.
	5 - Repeat steps 2 to 4 until one single cluster remains.
