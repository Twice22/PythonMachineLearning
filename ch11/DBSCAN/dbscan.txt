we will focus on the Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN).

In DBSCAN, a special label is assigned to each sample (pt) using the
following criteria

	. A point is considered as core point if at least a specified number
	  (MinPts) of neighboring points fall within the specified radius ɛ

	. A border pt is a pt that has fewer neighbors than MinPts within ɛ,
	  but lies within the ɛ radius of a core pt

	. All other points are neither core nor border points are considered
	  as noise points

After labeling the pts, DBSCAN algo works like this

	1 - Form a separate cluster for each core pt or a connected group of
		core points (core pt are connected if they are no farther than ɛ)

	2 - Assign each border pt to the cluster of its corresponding core pt


Advantage over k-means :
	- remove noise points
	- clusters have not necessarily a spherical shape as in k-means

Drawbacks :
	- 2 hyperparameters to determine a priori (MinPts and ɛ)
	- curse of dimensionality increases with the nb of features
	  Note : this is also the case with clustering algo that use metric
	  like k-means and hierarchical clustering
