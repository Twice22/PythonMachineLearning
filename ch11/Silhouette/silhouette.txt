silhouette plots is another way of quantified the quality of any cluster
algorithm. It works like this :

	1. Calculate the cluster cohesion a(i) as the average distance
	   between a sample x(i) and all other points in the same cluster

	2. Calculate the cluster separation b(i) from the next closest
	cluster as the average distance between the sample x(i) and all
	samples in the nearest cluster.

	3. Calculate the silhouette s(i) as the difference between cluster
	cohesion and separation divided by the greater of the two, as
	shown here :

		s(i) = (b(i) - a(i))/( max{b(i), a(i)})


silhouette coefficient = 0 => cluster separation and cohesion are equal
silhouette coefficient = 1 => ideal silhouette

silhouette_samples is available in scikit-learn's metric modul
and silhouette_scores can be imported
