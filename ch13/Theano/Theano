Theano is a tool designed to train machine learning models most
effectively using Python.

By default, Python is limited to execution on one core, due to the
Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). However, even if we take advantage of
its multiprocessing library to distribute computations over multiple
cores, we usually don't have more than 8 cores...

So the solution is to rely on the GPU rather than the CPU. Moreover
GPUs are relatively cheap compared to the state-of-the-art CPUs. For
example Graphic Card can easily have 400 times more core than CPU and
up to 15 (or more) floating-point calculations per second.
The problem is that we need our code to target the GPU which is not
trivial (can use CUDA, OpenCL). This is what Theano was developed for !

Theano is both a programming language, a compiler and a Python lib.
It is developed to implement, compile and evaluate mathematical expr
very efficiently with a strong focus on multidimensional arrays. It
is much faster than Numpy. It uses C/C++ implementation or CUDE/OpenCL
if we want to run it on the GPU.
